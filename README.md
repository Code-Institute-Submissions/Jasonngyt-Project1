## Project Surface

The theme by dodozhang21 used in the home page is chosen as it give visitors a clean and simple layout. The content is modified to fix the theme. The bottom navigation bar display the 5 main information part by part so that the visitor can digest the information better.

### Colours

Different shades of pink are used to communicate love, peace and kindness to the visitor.

### Logo

The icon has been taken from Shutterstocks. The rainbow sparkle above the child represent the different dreams that the child is trying to achieve. The overall shape of the logo looks like a tree which fit perfectly to the children home name Sparkle Tree.
